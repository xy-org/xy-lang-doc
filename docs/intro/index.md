This is the documentation, reference, and informal specification of the XY programming language.

The XY Programming Language aims to realize its creators' vision of how software
is to be created and help them in building better software. It is a rethinking of
some of the concepts assumed true in the past 20-30 year of programming.

The langauge is named after the greek letter [Ξ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_(letter)) (lowercase: ξ) which is transliterated as `XY` or `xy` and pronounced `/sai/`.

{: .highlight }
A [step-by-step tutorial](TLD) is provided elsewhere.

{: .importaint }
The language is not completely stable i.e. any part of the documentation is subject to change.
