This is the documentation, reference, and informal specification of the XY programming language.

The XY Programming Language aims to realize its creators' vision of how software
is to be created and help them in building better software. It is a rethinking of
some of the concepts assumed true in the past 20-30 year of programming.

The language is named after the greek letter [Ξ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_(letter)) (lowercase: ξ) which is transliterated as `XY` or `xy` and pronounced `/sai/`.

{: .important }
The language is not completely stable i.e. any part of the documentation is subject to change.

## Newcomers to XY

If you are new to the language it is advisable to start by reading the [step-by-step tutorial](/tutorial)
as this documentation assumes some familiarity with the language.
However you can also skim the documentation in order to get a feeling
for the language.

## How to Read This Documentation

The reader is free to read and consume this material however they wish but the
creators' recommendations are as follows:

* For pages that describe features in the language:
  1. Read the code examples
  2. Read the comments in the code examples
  3. Read the full description of the feature in question

* Pages that describe concepts in the language should be read from top to bottom
like a book.
